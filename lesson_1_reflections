Using history efficiency:
	being able to roll back to an early version to undo mistakes without making more

Manual Commits:
	allows for meaningful changes to be saved and has little downside like bloated versions
	of automatic commits if a commit is done for every logical change

Multi File Commits:
	git allows for a repository commit as a change can effect multiple files at once
	this isnt necisary in something like text editing on google docs as the files arnt
	compiled together

Using the git commands to view changes:
	using the git log will show commit history
	using git diff id_first id_second will show changes

Why woulf version control make you confident to make potentialy breaking changes:
	version control allows you to rollback to a previous change easily and compare differences to find bugs

What do i want to use git for:
	i want to use it to post versions of my programs online as a profile and use it to ease development
